# Vicious-Server

The Heroku server automatically deploys its server code from this GitHub repository.

The Heroku server is responsible for connecting to our MongoDB noSQL database for fetching our recipes. The web server interface for the server is using Express, while Node JS and Angular JS manage the networking and provider aspects.
